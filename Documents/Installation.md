# Installation

The application should be compiled (with AndroidStudio) from the
sources in this repository or downloaded from the **Releases** pages.  
The application package (such as GoToXX.apk) should be transferred
to the storage of the device (such as Downloads).  
Selecting it with a File Manager should offer the opportunity
to install it.

## Accessory installation

The application [Msb2Map](https://github.com/msb2kml/Msb2Map/)
should be installed if one want to look at a map.

# Permissions and activation

It is probable that the first utilization it should be asked to grant
the access to the storage (to read GPX files) and to the fine location
system.  
If the GPS is not active it is requested to activate it with a passage
to the Settings menu: a backspace returns to the application.  
If the GPS has been activated specifically for this application,
at the end, a new passage by the Settings lets you deactivate it.
