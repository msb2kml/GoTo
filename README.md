# Purpose
The purpose of this Android application is to use the embedded GPS
of the smartphone or the tablet to guide the user along a beeline
to a precise geographic location.  
It has been designed as a companion to the 
[Msb2And](https://github.com/msb2kml/Msb2And/) application: display
of telemetry data including GPS coordinates from a RC plane.
If there is a suspicion of lost plane at the end of the flight,
GoTo is invoked to help to retrieve the plane.

The guiding is performed with indications about the orientation
to follow. A map could be displayed if the application
[Msb2Map](https://github.com/msb2kml/Msb2Map/) is installed.

The GoTo application could be used in other contexts but it is not
a substitute for a regular hiking GPS.

# Installation
The application should be compiled from the sources in this
repository or downloaded from the **Releases** pages.

# Permissions
The application needs to have access to the GPS and the GPS has to
be activated.  
A read access to the internal and the external storage is needed
to read the coordinates if they are stored in a file.

# Documentation
The complete explanations are available in the **Documents** repertory.
